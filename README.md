# An accessible version of the python developers survey results

## Introduction

The [python developers survey results](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/) is great data for the python community and we believe that everyone should be able to access it.

This project will review the [python developers survey results](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/) and determine an alternative which is more [accessible to people with disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).

## Goals

1. Make a more accessible version of the [python developers survey results](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/).
2. Learn about [Accessible visualizations from Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module).
3. Learn about accessible data visualizations. A very tricky accessibility topic.
